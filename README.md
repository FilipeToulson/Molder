### Mould your music by having full controll over it

#### Play Music (Featrue not yet implemented)
Molder, being a music player, allows you to play any MP3's on your device.

#### Organise Your Music (Featrue not yet implemented)
With Molder's file browser functionaility you can organise your songs into their own directories, keeping certain songs
separate from each other. This allows you to have any sort of MP3 on your device without worrying that a specific song will 
show up in your queue for a specific directory.

With this comes the ability to:
- Create new directories
- Delete songs and directories
- Copy songs and directories
- Move songs and directories

With Molder you can edit:
- Song name
- Album name

And more.
